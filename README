Git Clone Instructions

1. Click the green "Code" button on github.
2. Copy the ssh link
3. Open a terminal in VSCODE (I use 'Git Bash' as my primary language)
4. Type: "git clone" then paste the ssh Code
5. Select folder location
6. Open the "index.html" file
7. On the bottom right of the entire window of VSCODE, click Go Live (The 'Live Server' extension by Ritwick Dey must be installed)
8. Explore Site

**Note**
Links and extra pages were not added

Whole purpose of the site was to get in the habit of never using pixels again to maintain consistency and responsiveness.

An extension called "Live Sass Compiler" also by Ritwick Dey lets me write styling code ins SASS (.scss/sass) and it is automatically
compiled into regular css. The file named "styles.css.map" is where all the converting magic (that I do not understand) happens.
(If anything, it reminds me of how a JSON file would look when I make web apps via REACT.JS)
